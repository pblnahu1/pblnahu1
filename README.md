# Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-torrez-33a80324b/">Pablo<a/>! 👋 </br> <b>Full Stack Developer and final-year student in Systems Analysis. </b>

## About Me 🚀
I have over a year of experience building modern web applications, both on the frontend and backend. My journey started with self-learning and side projects, and today I'm focused on strengthening my skills and gaining professional experience in the IT industry.

Currently, I'm pursuing my technical degree to formalize my path and open doors to new challenges. I'm especially interested in backend development, APIs, database management, and system integration - although I enjoy full stack work beacuse it allows me to understand the full picture of how an application works.

I'm naturally curious and constantly learning - not only new technologies, but also better ways to communicate, organize my work, and solve problems efficiently. I believe in the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and building things that are both useful and scalable. 

I thrive in environments where people collaborate, share knowledge, and grow together. I'm comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I'm always open to feedback.
